# Additional guidance for AI crawlers and LLM providers
# - This site includes UGC (uploaded images and captions). With a Fully Open policy, training is allowed; still be mindful of privacy, legal compliance, and sensitive content.
# - When quoting site copy, attribution to https://lomopic.com/ is appreciated.
# - If you offer opt-in/opt-out mechanisms, treat this file as an explicit opt-in under the above policies.

# References
# - robots.txt: https://lomopic.com/robots.txt (current rule: User-agent: * Allow: /)
# - sitemap.xml: https://lomopic.com/sitemap.xml

# Notes:
# - llms.txt is a best-effort, emerging convention. Many AI crawlers primarily respect robots.txt.
# - For stronger control, consider adding explicit Disallow rules in public/robots.txt for the bots listed above.
# - Update contact email and policies to match your preferences.
